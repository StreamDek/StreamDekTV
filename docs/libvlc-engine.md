# libVLC playback engine (TV)

libVLC is a third playback engine beside Media3 (ExoPlayer) and mpv, selectable in Settings >
Player > Default player and in the player's Engine panel.

**Status: not yet built or run on a device.** The code was written without an Android SDK. What
was checked is listed under "How this was verified"; what was not is under "Still to test".

## What it was checked against

- libVLC Android bindings **3.7.5** (source of `MediaPlayer`, `Media`, `IMedia`, `LibVLC`,
  `HWDecoderUtil` and the JNI layer) and **4.0.0-eap29**.
- VLC **3.0.x** and **master (4.0)** sources: the HTTP access module, the text renderer, the
  subtitle unit, the MediaCodec decoder, the MP4 demuxer.
- VLC for Android's own `VLCOptions.kt`, for how the reference app configures libVLC.

The dependency is `org.videolan.android:libvlc-all:3.7.7`, the current 3.x release and the one
VLC for Android builds with.

### Why not libVLC 4

4.0 is still a preview series (`eap`). Its bindings replace the integer track API with string ids
(`getTracks`, `selectTrack`), which would fix the one weakness noted under track details below.
For every other limitation here it changes nothing: the HTTP module has the same two options, the
subtitle renderer is still configured at creation, and there is still no buffered-range call.
`libvlc_video_set_spu_text_scale` exists in the 4.0 C API but the Android bindings do not expose
it. Moving a shipping app to a preview for one improvement is not worth it yet.

## Capability matrix

| Area | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom HTTP headers | **Still unsupported** - routed around | libVLC's HTTP access reads `http-user-agent` and `http-referrer` and nothing else, in 3.0 and 4.0. No option exists for `Authorization`, `Origin`, a preset `Cookie` or any other header. A source carrying such headers is **not tried on libVLC**: it plays on the Auto path (Media3, then mpv) and the viewer is told why. |
| ClearKey | **Still unsupported** - routed around | Same routing; only Media3 decrypts these. |
| Dynamic subtitle styling | **Newly implemented**, with a caveat | Every property (size, colour, opacity, background, outline, bold, position) is read once when libVLC's text renderer or subtitle unit is created; none can be changed on a running one through a supported call. A change during playback is now applied by reopening the same source at the same position about a second after the viewer stops adjusting, keeping the audio and subtitle selection. Playback pauses briefly. Shadow and font are not exposed by StreamDek's settings and are left at libVLC's defaults. |
| Buffered progress | **Still unsupported** | libVLC gives a fill percentage while rebuffering and byte counters, never a time or a range. Nothing is drawn rather than something invented. |
| Rich stream information | **Newly implemented** (partly) | Now shown: codec, profile and level, bit depth where the profile settles it, resolution, frame rate, video bitrate; audio codec, channels, sample rate, bitrate, language; transfer rate, current stream bitrate, frames decoded and dropped. **Not available from libVLC:** HDR format, Dolby Vision profile, decoder name, hardware-vs-software, passthrough state, container, buffer length. Sampled once a second and only while the info panel is open. |
| Track language metadata | **Newly implemented** | Language, title and codec come from libVLC's own track records; the `[Language]` in the display name is only the fallback. One limit: the 3.x bindings cache the first track list they return, so records are read once the picture is up, and a track added later (an external subtitle file) falls back to its name. |
| Dolby Vision | **Device-dependent** | VLC's MediaCodec decoder has no Dolby Vision handling in 3.0 or 4.0: it decodes the HEVC/AVC layer and applies no RPU. Profile 8 and profile 7 therefore play as their HDR10 base layer. Profile 5 has no compatible base layer and would show wrong colours. **Newly implemented:** an MP4 with a `dvhe`/`dvh1`/`dvav`/`dva1` sample entry (profile 5, and single-track profile 7) is handed to Media3, which uses the device's Dolby Vision decoder and already passes profile 7 to mpv. A Dolby Vision **MKV** carries no marker libVLC exposes, so it is not detected and plays as HDR10. |
| Automatic A/V fallback | **Newly implemented** | See "Engine routing". |

## Engine routing

All of it is in `PlaybackEngineRouting.kt` and unit-tested.

- **Auto** is unchanged: Media3 first, one hand-over to mpv.
- **libVLC chosen, source it cannot open** (headers, ClearKey): never tried on libVLC; goes to
  the Auto path with a notice.
- **libVLC fails before it has played** (open error, unsupported decoder, demux failure): the next
  engine takes over, with a notice.
- **libVLC plays half a source**: about eight seconds in, libVLC's own counters are read twice. An
  audio track that is selected but has decoded nothing while pictures are shown - or the reverse -
  hands the source to the next engine. Not applied to live channels, whose audio can start late.
- **Order after libVLC:** Media3, then mpv. libVLC is never the engine taking over: it shares
  FFmpeg with mpv and rarely rescues what mpv could not play.
- **No loops:** each source keeps a trail of the engines it has been on and which failed
  (`libVLC (failed) → ExoPlayer → mpv` in the log). A failed engine is not handed the same source
  again, and that now also applies to the existing Media3/mpv hand-overs.
- A manual switch in the Engine panel is always honoured.

## Facts for the routing layer

libVLC should not be chosen for a source when any of these is true:

1. It needs a request header other than `User-Agent` or `Referer` (`headersLibVlcCannotSend`).
2. It is ClearKey- or otherwise DRM-protected.
3. It is an MP4 with a Dolby Vision sample entry (detected only after opening).

And it will be weaker than the alternatives when: the viewer relies on the buffered-range display;
subtitle appearance is being adjusted often; or the info panel's decoder and HDR lines matter.

## Where it lives

- `ui/player/VlcPlaybackView.kt` - the engine, one more `MpvPlayerController`.
- `ui/player/LibVlcSupport.kt` - what libVLC can and cannot do, as pure functions (headers, Dolby Vision marker, codec/profile names, cache sizes, half-a-stream check).
- `ui/player/PlaybackEngineRouting.kt` - which engine a source starts on and which takes over.
- `ui/player/PlayerScreen.kt` - where those are applied.

## Battery and thermal pass

### libVLC - changed

- **Start-up buffering halved.** `network-caching` was 3 s for on-demand sources. That figure is
  latency before the first frame and after every seek, and a longer burst of radio at each start.
  Now 1.5 s for remote sources and 0.8 s for this device's loopback servers and home-network media
  servers; local files stay at libVLC's 0.3 s (the bindings would otherwise raise it to 1.5 s).
  libVLC lengthens its own delay when a stream runs late.
- **Hardware decoding confirmed, not changed.** The bindings resolve the existing setting to
  `:codec=mediacodec_ndk,all` - MediaCodec first with direct rendering to the surface
  (`mediacodec-dr` is on by default), software only when MediaCodec refuses. No frame leaves the
  GPU path. The compatibility surface uses a TextureView, which is still zero-copy.
- **No filters.** No deinterlacer, post-processing, equaliser or resampler is requested. The
  time-stretch filter is only inserted while the speed is not 1x.
- **Statistics** are on (the bindings need them for the info panel and the half-a-stream check).
  They are counters libVLC keeps as it decodes; nothing reads them unless the panel is open.
- **Leaving the app** releases the decoder, the surface and the network connection, and reopens at
  the same position on return, keeping the track selection.
- **Redundant work removed:** setters called on every recomposition no longer touch libVLC unless
  the value changed.

### mpv - changed

- **Progress reports throttled.** mpv reports its position once per frame; each report was a
  duration lookup through JNI and a post to the main thread, 24-60 times a second. The screen is
  now told four times a second (and at once after a seek), which is still twice Media3's rate.

### mpv - found, not changed: the default decode path copies every frame

`hwdec=auto-safe` (the default) and the `HW` setting both resolve to **`mediacodec-copy`**. In mpv, `auto-safe` only allows decoders on its whitelist, and plain `mediacodec` is
not on it. `mediacodec-copy` decodes in hardware but copies each frame back to CPU memory and
uploads it to the GPU again - for 4K HEVC that is hundreds of megabytes a second of copying, and
the most likely reason mpv runs hotter than the other engines.

It was left alone deliberately. Zero-copy `mediacodec` hands mpv an already-converted texture, so
mpv can no longer tone-map HDR itself, and HDR and Dolby Vision fallback content - which is exactly
what the Media3 -> mpv hand-over sends here - would look washed out. The change worth measuring on
real devices is `hwdec=mediacodec,mediacodec-copy` for SDR content only.

### Already in good shape

- Stream statistics and buffered ranges are polled only while the panel or the seek bar that shows
  them is on screen, in all three engines.
- Only one engine's view exists at a time; switching engine releases the other's decoder and surface.
- mpv runs `profile=fast` with no deband, sharpening or scaling shaders.

### Not changed, worth a look

- mpv cache sizes are generous. They are bounded in seconds and follow the viewer's Buffer Ahead
  setting, so they were left as a product decision.
- Refresh-rate matching was not touched. With mpv now presenting at the video's own rate, a display
  that switches to 24/48 Hz gets exactly one frame per refresh.

## How this was verified

- `VlcPlaybackView.kt` type-checks with no errors against the real libVLC 3.7.5 Java sources (with
  a stand-in for the Android framework).
- `LibVlcSupportTest` and `PlaybackEngineRoutingTest` (14 cases) were compiled and run and pass.
- The rest of the player was syntax-checked and compared against a baseline type check; no new
  genuine errors.
- Translations are complete for all eight languages; the hard-coded string count did not rise.

## Still to test (none of this has been run)

Functional, per engine: H.264 1080p, HEVC 1080p, HEVC 4K, HDR10, Dolby Vision (P5 MP4, P7 MKV, P8),
AV1, Live TV (HLS and MPEG-TS), HLS VOD, DASH, Plex, Jellyfin, debrid/add-on sources with and
without custom headers, external subtitles, high-bitrate local streams.

For libVLC specifically:

- [ ] A header-protected source is routed to ExoPlayer with the notice, without libVLC opening it
- [ ] A source libVLC cannot decode hands over once and does not loop
- [ ] Changing subtitle size mid-playback reopens once, at the same position, same tracks
- [ ] Track languages appear and the preferred language is picked automatically
- [ ] Info panel values are plausible (transfer rate and bitrate units in particular)
- [ ] Leave and return; screen off and on
- [ ] Release build (R8) starts libVLC; APK size

Power, Media3 vs mpv vs libVLC on identical content: CPU use, decoder in use, dropped frames,
memory, battery drain over 30 minutes, temperature, start-up time, seek latency. The mpv
`mediacodec` versus `mediacodec-copy` comparison above is the measurement most likely to matter.

## Other notes

- **Telemetry** carries no engine field for any engine; logs and the info panel name the engine.
- **Synced preference:** the engine setting is stored as `VLC`. Confirm the server and web portal
  accept it; older app versions read it as Auto.
- **Licence:** libVLC is LGPL-2.1.
