/**
 * The part of CloudStream's `ui.settings.Globals` that extensions call into.
 *
 * It lives in the CloudStream app rather than its provider API, so the trimmed runtime StreamDek
 * ships (libs/cloudstream-provider-runtime.jar) does not have it. Extensions that ask which layout
 * they are running under — CNCVerse's Cloudflare solver among them — failed with a missing class
 * the moment they did. Same package, same name and same members, so the call resolves here.
 *
 * StreamDek TV is always the TV layout.
