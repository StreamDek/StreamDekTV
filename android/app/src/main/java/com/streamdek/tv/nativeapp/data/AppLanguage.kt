/**
 * StreamDek's canonical interface-language model.
 *
 * # One specification, two installations
 *
 * This file is the specification, and - like `AnimationSpeed.kt` beside it - it is deliberately
 * duplicated verbatim, modulo the package line, in the other app. The two apps share no code, so
 * the alternative to duplicating it is the two of them drifting into different ideas of which
 * languages exist, what they are called, and what happens when a device asks for one StreamDek does
 * not have. Tags, native names, ordering, resolution and fallback behaviour must stay identical in
 * both copies; only the storage and the settings row differ.
 *
 * The *selection* is emphatically not shared. It is a property of the installation, not of the
 * account or the viewing profile: a household can reasonably have a television in one language and
 * a phone in another, and somebody who changes the phone has not asked to change the television. So
 * it is written to device-local storage on each side and never travels through SyncDek, the profile
 * document, cloud preferences or the backend - the same rule [AnimationSpeed] follows.
 *
 * # What this is not
 *
 * This is the language of StreamDek's *interface*: its menus, buttons, dialogs, errors and player
 * controls. It is a separate preference from Preferred Audio Language and Preferred Subtitle
 * Language, which describe what should come out of the speakers and appear over the picture, and
 * which live on the profile because they follow the person rather than the device. Someone can
 * reasonably read a Polish interface while listening to English audio. Do not collapse the three.
 *
 * It is also not a translator for anything a metadata provider or a stream source hands us. Film and
 * series titles, cast names, add-on and provider names, file names and URLs stay exactly as they
 * arrive. Where TMDB can supply genuinely localised metadata for the selected language we ask it
 * for that - see [metadataLanguageTag] - but that is a request for a different document, not a
 * translation of this one.
 *
 * # Adding a language
 *
 * Three steps, and no UI file is touched:
 *
 *  1. add an entry here, in both copies of this file;
 *  2. add `values-<tag>/strings.xml` in both apps;
 *  3. add the tag to `res/xml/locales_config.xml` in both apps.
 *
 * `scripts/check-translations.mjs` then validates the result, and the settings row picks the new
 * entry up from [AppLanguage.entries] without being edited.

 * ignores it and nothing changes, and the fallback chain requirement 6 asks for is exactly what the

 * The chain is: the regional locale, then the bare language, then English - so `pt-BR, pt;q=0.9,

 * than nothing. Anything the provider still cannot supply falls to the provider's own default,

 *
 * This governs *metadata*, never interface text: a synopsis or a certification label TMDB has
