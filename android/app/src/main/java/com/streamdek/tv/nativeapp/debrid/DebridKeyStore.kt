/**
 * Where this device keeps the premium-service API keys it calls providers with.
 *
 * The keys arrive from StreamDek's server, which holds the encrypted copy so an account can sync
 * to a TV, and are kept here so the device can reach Real-Debrid, TorBox and the rest itself
 * rather than asking a server to do it on its behalf.
 *
 * Encrypted with a key that lives in the Android Keystore and never leaves it: what is written to
 * preferences is ciphertext, and the key that opens it is not in the file, not in the APK, and not
 * extractable from the device. Plain SharedPreferences would have left a working credential
 * readable to anything that could reach the app's data directory, and rooted devices and backup
 * extractions both can.
 *
 * `androidx.security:security-crypto` does exactly this and was the obvious choice, but it is no
 * longer maintained — its stable release predates the Keystore APIs used here, and taking on an
 * unmaintained security dependency for sixty lines of AES/GCM is the worse trade.
