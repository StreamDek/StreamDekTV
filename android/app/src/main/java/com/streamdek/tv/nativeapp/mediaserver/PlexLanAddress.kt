/*
 * A plain local address for a Plex server, for networks that will not resolve plex.direct.
 *
 * Plex lists a server's home-network connection as an HTTPS address under plex.direct, a name that
 * resolves to the server's private IP ("192-168-1-20.<id>.plex.direct" -> 192.168.1.20). Many
 * routers refuse to resolve a public name to a private address - DNS rebinding protection, on by
 * default on several of them and in some DNS services - and then that connection simply fails.
 * With remote access and Relay also unavailable, the server can never be reached from the sofa it
 * sits next to, which is how "I can't add my local server" looks from the outside.
 *
 * The IP is in the name, so the same server can be asked over plain HTTP on the network directly,
 * which Plex accepts from the local network unless secure connections are set to Required. It is
 * tried after the HTTPS address, never instead of it.
