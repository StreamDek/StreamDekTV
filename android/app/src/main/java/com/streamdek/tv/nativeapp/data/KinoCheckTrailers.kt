/**
 * Which video is a title's trailer, according to KinoCheck.
 *
 * The metadata service's own list is not a list of trailers. It is every video a studio published,
 * newest first, which in the weeks around a release is a wall of ticket adverts: "NOW PLAYING"
 * stings of six to fifteen seconds, IMAX spots, social cutdowns. The resolver ranks them on running
 * time to find the real trailer among them, and does well, but it cannot invent one — for a title
 * whose fourteen entries are all adverts, the best available answer is a twenty-five second advert.
 *
 * KinoCheck publishes one curated trailer per title, keyed by the same TMDB id already in hand, and
 * marks each video with what it is. So the pick is read rather than inferred, Shorts never enter the
 * list, and titles whose studio upload was taken down still have something to play.
 *
 * Only the *identity* comes from here. KinoCheck hosts no video: the answer is a YouTube id, and
 * playback is the same resolver path as everything else, so the fallback behind this is the whole
 * existing pipeline rather than nothing.

/**
 * How far into a KinoCheck video the trailer itself starts.
 *
 * Their uploads open with a branded sting. Three and a half seconds clears it while leaving the
 * trailer's own first frame intact — five overshot into the opening shot, so playback begins past it — but only
 * when the URL in hand will serve a span that does not start at byte zero. See
 * TrailerPlaybackSource.seekable: the gated client answers 403 to a mid-file range, and asking it
 * for one does not skip the sting, it kills the trailer.
