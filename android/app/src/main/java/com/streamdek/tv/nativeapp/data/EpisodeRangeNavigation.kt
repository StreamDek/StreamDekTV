/**
 * Getting to episode 176 of a 200-episode season.
 *
 * A season is a horizontal strip of cards, which is a fine way to look at twelve episodes and a
 * terrible way to reach the hundred-and-seventy-sixth: the list is already lazy, so nothing is
 * slow, but the distance is real and there is no way to cross it except to keep swiping.
 *
 * The fix is to stop treating one long season as one long list. Past a threshold the season is cut
 * into blocks of twenty, the viewer picks a block, and the strip shows only that block - so the
 * furthest any episode ever sits from the start of the strip is nineteen cards. Anything shorter
 * than the threshold is left exactly as it was: a season of ten does not need navigating, and
 * wrapping it in machinery would make the common case worse to serve the rare one.
 *
 * All of it is plain arithmetic over episode numbers, with no Android or Compose types. This is a
 * verbatim copy of the mobile app's file of the same name - the two apps share no code, and this
 * is the one place where the two must not be allowed to disagree, so it is copied rather than
 * reimplemented and both repos carry the same tests over it.
