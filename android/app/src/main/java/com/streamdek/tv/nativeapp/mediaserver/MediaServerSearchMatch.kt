/*
 * Whether a media server's search result is actually about what was searched for.
 *
 * Servers answer a search with more than title matches. Plex's search returns hubs of titles
 * linked to the query some other way - through an actor, a director, a genre, a collection - and,
 * when nothing in the library is called what was typed, whatever it considers related. Shown in a
 * section headed by the server's name, those read as matches: searching "Euphoria" listed Tracker,
 * Supergirl and Hoppers. So a result is kept only when one of its titles answers the query.
 *
 * The comparison ignores case, accents and punctuation ("amelie" finds "Amélie", "spiderman" finds
 * "Spider-Man"), wants every word of the query in the title in any order, and forgives one slip in
 * a longer word ("euphria" still finds "Euphoria"), which is about as far as a server's own fuzzy
 * matching reaches that is worth keeping.
