/**

 * down, and whether tunneled output helps or breaks, is a property of the silicon in front of the
 * viewer — a stick and a phone will not agree, and copying one's answer onto the other is how a
 * working player gets broken from another room. Read at the moment a player is built, so a change
 * takes effect on the next thing played rather than needing a restart.

/**
 * Dolby Vision profile 7, and what can actually be done about it.
 *
 * Media3 copes with most Dolby Vision on a device that cannot decode it: when the display does not
 * report support, `MediaCodecVideoRenderer` asks for an alternative codec and
 * `MediaCodecUtil.getAlternativeCodecMimeType` answers HEVC for profiles 4 and 8, AVC for 9 and AV1
 * for 10. Profile 7 -- the dual-layer format disc remuxes use -- is the one profile with no answer.
 *
 * The failure is worse than a refusal. A television with a Dolby Vision decoder accepts a profile 7
 * stream, decodes it, reports a first frame and a healthy frame rate, and shows black. Nothing
 * errors, so the player's own "Media3 failed, try mpv" path never fires: it hangs off an error
 * callback, and there is no error.
 *
 * Handing the stream to an HEVC decoder instead was tried and is not reliable. The base layer is
 * ordinary HEVC and the extra NAL units are ones a conforming decoder must ignore, so in principle
 * it works -- but a hardware decoder is far less forgiving than a software one about NAL types it
 * did not expect, and on the hardware this was tested against it stayed black. mpv plays the same
 * file correctly, because ffmpeg decodes the base layer and skips the rest. So rather than trying
 * to talk MediaCodec into it, the stream is simply sent to the engine that already handles it.
 *
 * Detection is deliberately generous. Profile 7 when the codec string says so; also when the codec
 * string says nothing at all, which is the common case for Matroska, because a Dolby Vision stream
 * that reaches here with no readable profile is far more likely to be a disc remux than one of the
 * single-layer streaming profiles -- and those play correctly on a device with a Dolby Vision
 * decoder, which is not a device anyone turns this setting on for.
