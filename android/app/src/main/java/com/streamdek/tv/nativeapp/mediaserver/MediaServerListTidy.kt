/*
 * Tidying the server list in Settings: taking one library or one server off the list without
 * disconnecting everything, and folding a server's libraries away.
 *
 * "Removed" is two things together. The library or server is switched off - that part is the
 * profile's, saved the way every other switch is, so it stops appearing anywhere in StreamDek on
 * every device. And this device stops listing it in Settings, which is what makes it removed
 * rather than merely off. It is kept under "Removed" so it can be brought back; nothing is deleted
 * from the server itself, which StreamDek has no business doing.
 *
 * A Jellyfin server is the exception: it has its own sign-in, so removing one really does sign out
 * of that server alone.
