/**
 * The trailer pipeline's own cache, kept apart from everything else the app stores.
 *
 * Trailers are the one part of StreamDek whose upstream actively works against being cached. A
 * YouTube media URL carries its own expiry, the player response that issued it is only valid for
 * that window, and the WebView the iframe fallback runs in keeps cookies and site storage that
 * YouTube uses to decide whether the caller looks like a browser or a bot. Stale state in any of
 * those makes trailers fail in ways that look like a broken app: a resolve that succeeds followed
 * by 403s from the media host, or an embed that reports ERROR before it has drawn anything.
 *
 * Clearing it therefore has to be possible without touching add-on responses, artwork, subtitles or
 * downloaded torrent data — which is why the trailer cache has its own directory and this object
 * owns everything that counts as trailer state.
