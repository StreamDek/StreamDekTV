 * how the app ended up offering nine languages for audio and a different nine for subtitles, with
 * everything else falling back to English — and any list short enough to type is short enough to be
 * wrong for somebody. Built this way it covers every ISO language, names them in the viewer's own
 * display language, and cannot drift from the codes the players and add-ons actually use.
 *
 * Recognition is the harder half. The same language arrives as "en", "eng", "en-US", "English" and
 * "English (SDH)" depending on whether it came from a container, a add-on, a file name or a person,
 * so [normalize] accepts all of those and answers with the two-letter code.
