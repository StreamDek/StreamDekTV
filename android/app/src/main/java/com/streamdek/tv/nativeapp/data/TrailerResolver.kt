/**
 * YouTube trailer resolution, carried over from StreamDek Mobile.
 *
 * Deliberately a near-verbatim port rather than a rewrite. Everything difficult about this file is
 * empirical — which YouTube client answers anonymously this month, which of its URLs can be read to
 * the end, how a promotional cutdown is told apart from the actual trailer — and all of it was
 * learned against a live service that keeps moving. Keeping the two copies diffable is what makes
 * the next fix on either platform portable to the other; restructuring it for the television would
 * buy nothing and lose that.
 *
 * Two things are left out because the television has no use for them: the Vimeo path and the iframe
 * fallback, both of which need a WebView, and the signed-in cookie jar that fallback filled. The
 * [youtubeCookies] parameter is kept so the shapes still line up, and the TV always passes null.

 * answer is 403 — intermittently, depending on which way each connection happened to go.
