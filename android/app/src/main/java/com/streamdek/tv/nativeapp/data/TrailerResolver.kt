 * learned against a live service that keeps moving. Keeping the two copies diffable is what makes
 * the next fix on either platform portable to the other; restructuring it for the television would

 * **The master is what gets played, never a variant.** YouTube's manifests come from
 * `manifest.googlevideo.com/api/manifest/hls_variant/...`, and in them the audio is not inside the
 * video variants: it sits in separate `#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO` renditions that each
 * `#EXT-X-STREAM-INF` refers to by an `AUDIO="234"` group id. Resolving down to a variant playlist
 * and handing that over — the obvious thing to do, and what a naive reading of the manifest invites —
 * produces a trailer that plays in silence. So the master is passed through whole and Media3 wires
 * the renditions together; the manifest is read here only to learn what is actually inside it.
 *
 * **A video with dubs does not go down this path at all.** On a multi-language upload every
 * language is a rendition in the same audio group and *not one of them* is marked `DEFAULT=YES` —
 * measured on a trailer with eight: all eight said `DEFAULT=NO,AUTOSELECT=YES`. Media3 then falls
 * back to picking by device locale, and on a device whose language is not among them it takes
 * whichever rendition came first, which is alphabetical rather than original. The adaptive path has
 * an unambiguous answer for this — `audioTrack.audioIsDefault`, see [selectAdaptiveAudio] — so
 * multi-language videos are left to it.
 *
 * A failure to read the manifest is not a failure of the trailer: null drops HLS out of the running
 * and the progressive and adaptive candidates answer instead. That matters because this fetch is
 * the one part of resolution whose host differs from the player API's, and a network that blocks it
 * should not cost the viewer a trailer.
