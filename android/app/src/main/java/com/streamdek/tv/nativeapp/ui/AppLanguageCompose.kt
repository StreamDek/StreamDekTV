 * without reaching into the UI layer and so that all of it is reachable from a plain JVM test. This

 *
 * # Why this exists rather than a call to recreate()
 *
 * Applying a locale by overriding the activity's base context - which [localizedAppContext] does,
 * and which is all this app used to have - cannot take effect until the activity is built again.
 * Recreating it works, but it throws away the composition: on the phone the settings page it was
 * changed from disappears and rebuilds, and on the television every focus requester in the tree is
 * reconstructed, which drops the remote's focus back to wherever the screen decides to put it.
 * Changing the language is not supposed to feel like the app restarted, and losing your place on a
 * television is exactly what that feels like.
 *
 * Overriding the composition locals instead is what `stringResource` actually reads: it looks up
 * `LocalContext.current.resources`, and takes a dependency on `LocalConfiguration.current` so that
 * a configuration change invalidates it. Providing both means every string in the tree re-resolves
 * on the next recomposition, in place, with the scroll position, the open dialog and the focused
 * control all still where they were.
 *
 * [localizedAppContext] is still needed and still runs, for everything that is not this composition:
 * the window the activity opens with, notification channel names, and anything a service builds.
 *
 * # Why the configuration is copied here but not there
 *
 * [localizedAppContext] builds a bare `Configuration` precisely so it does not pin the day/night
 * bits at process start - see the comment there. Here the opposite is correct: [LocalConfiguration]
 * is live, `remember` is keyed on it, and so copying it preserves every field the platform is
 * currently reporting (night mode, font scale, screen size) while replacing only the locale, and
 * re-copies the moment any of them changes.

/**
 * A context that resolves resources in the interface language while still being the activity.

 * `createConfigurationContext` does not return a wrapper around the activity: it returns a fresh
 * `ContextImpl` parented to the application, with the activity nowhere in its base-context chain.
 *
 * androidx finds the `ActivityResultRegistryOwner`, the `OnBackPressedDispatcherOwner` and their
 * siblings by walking `baseContext` up from `LocalContext`, and that walk stops dead at a
 * `ContextImpl`. Providing one as `LocalContext` therefore threw
 * "No ActivityResultRegistryOwner was provided via LocalActivityResultRegistryOwner" out of
 * `rememberLauncherForActivityResult` on the very first composition, and left every
 * [findActivity] in the app quietly answering null.
 *
 * Wrapping keeps the activity in the chain where those lookups can reach it. Overriding
 * `getResources` is the whole of what the language needs: `stringResource` reads
 * `LocalContext.current.resources`, and everything else about the context stays exactly as it was.
