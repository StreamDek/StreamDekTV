/*
  * Which engine plays a source, and which one takes over when the one playing cannot.
  *
  * The rules, in one place:
  *
  *  - "Auto" is Media3 first with one hand-over to mpv, as it always was.
  *  - libVLC plays when the viewer chose it - unless the source is one libVLC is known not to be
  *    able to open (see [LibVlcBlocker]), in which case nothing is gained by trying: the source
  *    goes straight to the Auto path and the viewer is told why.
  *  - When the engine that is playing turns out not to be able to play a source, the next engine
  *    that has not already failed on that source takes over. libVLC is never the one taking over:
  *    it shares FFmpeg with mpv, so it rarely rescues what mpv could not play.
  *  - An engine that has failed on a source is not tried on it again, so there are no loops.
