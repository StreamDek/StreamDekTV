/**
 * Timing instrumentation for the journeys a viewer actually waits through.
 *
 * Deliberately not built on [Telemetry]: this has to be readable from `adb logcat` on a stick while
 * a build is being driven by hand, and it has to cost nothing when it is switched off. Telemetry
 * batches and uploads; this prints one line per phase and keeps no history.
 *
 * Line format, chosen so `logcat -s StreamDekPerf` can be parsed with `cut`:
 *
 *     PERF|<span>|<phase>|<msSinceSpanStart>|<msSincePreviousPhase>|<detail>
 *
 * A "span" is one user-visible journey (a home load, a play press). Phases inside it are the
 * moments the viewer could notice something changed. Spans are identified by name plus an
 * incrementing id, so two overlapping home loads do not interleave into one unreadable trace.
