/**
 * Bundled branded artwork for the Streaming Networks row.
 *
 * The row's classic card is the service's TMDB logo fitted onto a white tile — correct, but it
 * reduces every service to the same white rectangle. These tiles are the service's own wordmark on
 * its own colour, so the row reads as a shelf of brands rather than a grid of stamps. They ship
 * with the app rather than coming down with the row because they are branding, not content: they
 * do not change between deploys, and a tile that has to be fetched is a tile that is blank on a
 * cold start.
 *
 * The classic card carries bundled artwork too — see [networkLogoArt]. Its logo used to be the
 * one `/tmdb/networks` supplies, which is a thumbnail sized for a provider list and visibly soft
 * on a card this size.
 *
 * Only the artwork on hand is mapped. A service with neither a tile nor a logo falls back to the
 * one the row supplied (see `NetworkCard`), so these tables growing or shrinking can never
 * empty a card.

 * Watch-provider ids, which are what `/tmdb/networks` puts in a tile's `id`.

 * and the `altIds` a service is carried under elsewhere (Paramount+ is split into tiers in the US,
 * Starz is Lionsgate+ outside it). Ids are matched before names because a provider id is stable
 * across regions and renames, and the name is not.
