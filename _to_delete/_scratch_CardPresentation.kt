 * The card shape a catalogue asks for, from Stremio's `posterShape`.

 * Stremio defines it on every catalogue item (`MetaPreview.posterShape`): "poster" is the 2:3
 * default, "square" is 1:1 and "landscape" is a wide card. Add-ons that let the viewer pick a card
 * style - TopX among them - answer by changing this field and the artwork together: the item's
 * `poster` is itself drawn wide, and a separate wide `landscapePoster` is often supplied as well.
 * The field is per item, so it survives every catalogue, page and genre the add-on serves.
 *
 * Shared with the TV app, which reads the same field the same way; only card sizes differ.
